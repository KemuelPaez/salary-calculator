				<h4 style="color: #00b89c;">Explanation</h4>
				The salary calculations work by first converting different salary types into a monthly salary. 
				If the salary is given as a daily wage, it is multiplied by 22, assuming 22 working days in a month. 
				If it is a weekly salary, it is multiplied by 4, considering four weeks per month. 
				A semi-monthly salary is doubled since there are two pay periods in a month, while a monthly salary remains unchanged.
				and the annual salary is calculated by multiplying the monthly salary by 12. This allows users to see how their earnings translate across different timeframes based on a standard work schedule.
